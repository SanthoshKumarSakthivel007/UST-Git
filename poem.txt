In the depths of night, the stars softly gleam,
Whispering secrets in a moonlit dream.
Shadows dance, a mysterious ballet,
As the world sleeps, lost in night's sway.
The wind sings a lullaby, gentle and low,
Caressing the earth with a soothing flow.
Dreams take flight on wings of imagination,
Carrying us to lands of pure fascination.
Night's embrace, a comforting shroud,
In its quietude, we find solace profound.
